This ensures accurate and timely processing of transactions in alignment with the period schedule.

## Events

Before initiating an event file upload in Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, it's essential to ensure that the file has been meticulously linked with a POB (Performance Obligation) template. This linkage is paramount for the proper mapping of events, ensuring that revenue recognition is both accurate and aligned with contractual obligations.

### How to upload event files

1. Navigate to the Import/Export section and select "Events."
2. Initiate the upload process for a new event file by clicking on the "+" button.\

3. Assign a name to the event file. By default, the system will adopt the name of the uploaded file. Subsequently, select the relevant event from the dropdown menu. These events are essentially predefined templates established in the system.
4. Once all the necessary details are populated, save the file. The system will then process the uploaded event file in accordance with the configurations set for that specific event, ensuring that revenue recognition is both accurate and compliant with established rules.

## Stage area

The Stage Area in Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced contains four tabs: Contracts, Documents, Cost, and Events. Unprocessed files related to each tab will be displayed under their respective tabs. There are several reasons why files may remain unprocessed in the Stage Area:

* **Error in the file:** If there are any errors encountered during the upload of Contracts, Documents, Cost, or Event files, those files will be placed in the Stage Area. The system usually displays error messages corresponding to each transaction, indicating the issue that needs to be addressed.
* **Future transactions:** If any transactions have a future date or period assigned to them and they are uploaded into the system during the current period, these transactions will be held in the Stage Area until the applicable period for those transactions is opened in the system. This ensures that transactions are processed accurately based on their respective periods.
* **Scheduled processing:** If the scheduled jobs for transaction import or event import are not run or are inactive, it can cause transactions to remain stuck in the Stage Area. It is important to ensure that the scheduled jobs are active and properly configured to process the transactions as intended.

### How to view and delete data in the stage area

1. To access the Stage Area, navigate to Import/Export.
2. The "Status" tab provides a structured view of the files, allowing users to filter and view files based on specific criteria.
3. To delete specific data, select the transaction under the respective tab, click the Delete icon, and confirm the deletion. Always remember to save changes to finalize the removal.
