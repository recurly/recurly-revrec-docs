# Invoice origin data

Invoice origin refers to the starting point or the reason why an invoice was created. It helps identify what triggered the invoice in a company's system.

## Configuring invoice origin reports

1. **Access Invoice Origins**: Navigate to the Liability Balance report and look for the **Invoice Origin** option. If you donâ€™t immediately see it in the main list of checkboxes, open the mapper tool. Make sure to check the **Invoice Origin** box for both the search criteria and the results display to ensure it's included in your report analysis.
2. **Generate the Report**: Click the **Run** button to process your request.
3. **View Results**: The report will now display data pivoted specifically by invoice origin, offering detailed insights into different transaction types.

### Invoice origin types

* **Purchase, Add-On, Renewals**: Represents the core revenue-generating contracts of the company, including initial purchases, additional services, and subscription renewals.
* **Credit, Write-Off, Refunds**: These categories are linked to financial adjustments and returns processed for customers, reflecting changes in revenue recognition.
* **Immediate Change**: This origin is associated with mid-period contract modifications that may affect the financial standing or service terms.
* **Gift Card**: Tracks the issuance of gift cards within the reporting period, marking their impact on financial metrics and customer engagement.

By following these streamlined steps, you can effectively generate and analyze the liability balances report, adjusting the displayed data according to your specific needs.
