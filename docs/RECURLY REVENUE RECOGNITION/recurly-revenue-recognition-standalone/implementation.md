# Implementation process

A dedicated Enablement Manager will assist you throughout the process, from initial discussions to moving the solution into production.

## Phase 1 - BRD Creation and review

Begin by collaborating with Recurly to create and review the Business Requirements Document (BRD). This document will help define how you want your Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone edition site to be configured to meet your business needs.

## Phase 2 - Core design & configuration

Using the BRD document, you will work on designing the solution and configuring the Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone edition module. This phase includes setting up templates, participating in design reviews, and providing your approval on the final design to provide it aligns with your revenue recognition strategy.

## Phase 3 - Integration

Focus on integrating your systems seamlessly to provide a smooth flow of data and operations. During this phase, you'll review and sign off on test scenarios while validating configurations and preparing necessary data. You will develop test cases, which Recurly will review. Any issues identified will be addressed to provide a robust system. Refer to the Import/Export section for details on the API calls used for data import.

## Phase 4 - User acceptance testing (UAT)

During User Acceptance Testing (UAT), you'll provision data, perform data conversions, and execute UAT scenarios. You will review the results with guidance from Recurly, if necessary. Once you're satisfied with the solution, you'll sign off on the UAT.

## Phase 5 - Go live

In the final phase, you'll go live with the Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone edition solution. Recurly will help prepare a cutover plan, set up the production environment, and deploy the necessary services. You'll perform a final sanity check in the production environment, and with Recurly's support, transition from testing to the live environment.
