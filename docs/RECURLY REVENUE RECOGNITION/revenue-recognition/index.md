# What is ‘Revenue Recognition’?

Revenue Recognition is a fundamental accounting principle that determines when and how revenue should be recognized on a company's financial statements. It outlines the rules and guidelines for when revenue can be recorded as earned and how it should be allocated over time.

In simple terms, revenue recognition is about properly recognizing and reporting the income a business generates from its products and/or services. It ensures that revenue is recorded in the right period and matches the corresponding costs and expenses.

Compliance with revenue recognition standards, such as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the US and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) globally, is essential for businesses to maintain transparency, accuracy, and consistency in their financial reporting.

Under ASC 606/IFRS 15 five steps have been identified to determine revenue recognition:\
Step 1 – Identify contract with the Customer
Step 2 – Identify the separate performance obligations within the contract
Step 3 – Determine transaction price
Step 4 – Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
Step 5 – Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

By following these standards, businesses can provide a clear and reliable picture of their financial performance, which is crucial for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to assess the company's health and make informed decisions.
