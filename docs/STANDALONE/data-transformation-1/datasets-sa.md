# Overview

Datasets in Recurly RevRec are dynamic, user-defined tables of attributes—such as item, account, region, or customer—that drive every report and analysis. Once created, datasets refresh nightly to keep your insights up to date.

# Definition

A **Dataset** is a custom collection of fields (attributes) from your sales orders and contracts, organized into a reusable table for reporting and analysis. Datasets cannot be deleted, only inactivated, preserving historical integrity while preventing future use.

# Key benefits

* **Tailored analytics**: Pick exactly the attributes you need—item, liability account, region, customer—and build bespoke data tables.
* **Always current**: Datasets auto-refresh daily, so your dashboards and reports reflect yesterday’s latest sales and revenue.
* **Safe versioning**: Inactivate outdated datasets rather than delete, ensuring audit trails remain intact while retiring superseded configurations.

> **Note:** Datasets cannot be permanently deleted; you can only toggle a dataset to **Inactive** to retire it from future use while retaining historical records.

# FAQ

**Q: How do I manage and use Data Sets for custom data ingestion in the RevRec application?**
A: Go to **Application setup → Data sets** to define schemas, map fields, and set validations. You can load data via the UI or API, then reference those data sets in **Data transformation** rules and the **Workbench**.
