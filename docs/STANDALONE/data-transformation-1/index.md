# Overview

### Required plan

The Standalone Revenue Recognition module is available to merchants who need a revenue tool to automate their ASC 606 / IFRS 15 accounting but do not, at this time, need the Recurly billing platform.

### Cost

Please reach out to [support@recurly.com](mailto:support@recurly.com) for more pricing details.

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with the organization's revenue recognition standards.
* Understanding of product bundling and data rule configurations.
* Knowledge of the desired attributes for data transformation.

### Limitations

* Dataset, product bundle and data rules cannot be deleted. They can only be inactivated or modified.

### Key benefits

* **Streamlined Data Management:** Efficiently manage product bundles, apply customized data rules, and analyze data for accurate revenue recognition.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** Create datasets for in-depth data analysis, with daily automatic refreshes ensuring up-to-date information.
* **Customizable Configurations:** Tailor product bundles, data rules, and datasets to specific business requirements.
* **Consistent Reporting:** Datasets ensure uniformity in data analysis and reporting across different functionalities.
