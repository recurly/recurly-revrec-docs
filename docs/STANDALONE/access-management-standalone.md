Please reach out to [support@recurly.com](mailto:support@recurly.com) for more pricing detail

### Prerequisites

* A valid Recurly account with appropriate permissions.
* A basic understanding of Recurly Revenue Recognition processes.

# User management

Recurly App and Revenue Recognition work together to manage user roles within Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone. In the Recurly App, you can invite users and assign them a role. Once they accept the invitation, you can further define their permissions in the Revenue Recognition App.

## Recurly App user management

In the Recurly App, there are two key roles: Revenue Recognition and User Admin. The Revenue Recognition role is read-only, allowing users to view data and download reports within the Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone, without making changes. The User Admin role provides full access, including managing users, adjusting settings, and overseeing workflows.

### Adding a new user

To invite a new user:

1. **Go** to the Users menu on the left.

2. In the upper right, **click** on User Actions and select Invite User.
3. **Enter** the email address of the new user and assign either the Revenue Recognition (read-only) or User Admin role. Then, click Send Invite.

4. The user will receive an email invitation. They need to accept the invite and create their account.

Once the user accepts the invitation, they will access the system via the Recurly App. You can later modify their roles within the Recurly Revenue Recognition Access Management Users menu.

## Recurly Revenue Recognition App user management

A user assigned the read-only role in the Recurly App will have read-only access to all features in Recurly Revenue Recognition Standalone. Users with admin access can both view and modify all aspects of the Recurly Revenue Recognition App. You can further customize access by creating additional roles to control access to specific elements, based on the user's responsibilities.

### Creating a role in the Recurly Revenue Recognition App

1. **Open** the Recurly Revenue Recognition App.
2. **Navigate** to Access Management and select Roles.
3. **Click** the "+" button to create a new role.
