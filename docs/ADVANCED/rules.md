### POB Forecasting

In most cases, revenue is recognized on the date the contract is booked or billed. However, for some contracts, revenue recognition is delayed until a specific external event occurs.

Forecast Management allows you to forecast revenue based on both external events and billing dates. Even if the exact date of an external event (like a product release) is unknown, you can still factor it into your forecast by assuming it will happen by the contract end date. This enables you to plan your revenue based on a predictable contract end date.

#### Steps for configuring the Forecast for POBs:

1. Navigate to the required POB
2. Click on Forecast. This will land you in the forecast page. 
3. Select the waterfall type for forecast.\
   Point in time\
   Overtime\
   Overtime Slide\
   Overtime Condense
4. Enter the percent of revenue you need to forecast based on this rule. At any given point, the forecast release should not be more than 100%.
5. Select the “forecast on” date. This is the date on which revenue has to be forecasted. The system gives several forecasts on options like Book Date, Start date, End date, delivery date.
6. Enter the no. of days for the forecast to start or end in the start day and end day. Accordingly the forecast would be done by the system. For example, When forecast on is Book date and if we give start day as 30, system will create forecast after Book date + 30 days

## Standalone selling price

Setting up the Stand-Alone Selling Price (SSP) involves a streamlined process consisting of three key steps. Firstly, you will create the SSP by defining values, specifying pricing attributes, and configuring adjustments or discounts. Secondly, you will set the SSP Analyzer rules, establishing criteria for identifying and analyzing SSP variances, and customizing them to align with your business requirements. Lastly, you will prepare and upload the necessary data into the SSP Analyzer tool, ensuring accurate processing and analysis. By following these steps diligently, you can establish a robust SSP framework tailored to your products or services, enabling precise determination of stand-alone selling prices.

Note: All the other fields like range, type, stats, value and base would be seen as configured while configuring the SSP. You cannot make any changes here.

6. Once it is done, add criteria. Criteria means the data that has to be included while deriving the SSP values. In the below screenshot, you can see the criteria as greater than a certain book date. 
7. Once the criteria is defined, click on the analysis icon on the right hand side. Now, the system will collect all the data that matches the criteria and gives us the SSP breakup as per the grouping.
8. As the SSP grouping was “Item”, the data collected is spread into different rows based on the grouping. This complete the data collection process.
9. Now the SSP needs to be approved to use the same.

## Variable considerations

In Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, the setup for automatically applying variable consideration (VC) estimates to transaction lines is done on the Variable Considerations page. Variable considerations refer to charges associated with discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, and other similar items that are determined by factors unrelated to the cost of producing goods or services. These amounts can be estimated using historical data and other calculations. 

### How to configure Variable Considerations

1. **Go** to Rules → Variable Considerations.

2. **Click** on the "+" button to create a new VC template.

3. **Name** the VC template.

4. **Specify** the VC type, which is used to group VC of similar types (e.g., favorable VC).

5. **Ensure** that the VC-related accounts in your ERP system are accurately reflected:
   1. **Accrual Account:** A liability account used for VC accrual.
   2. **Contra Account:** A revenue account for VC revenue.
   3. **Clearing Account:** A clearing account associated with VC.\
      ![](https://files.readme.io/05b4de3-image.png)

6. **Define** the timing for VC accrual.

7. **Enter** the active dates for the VC.

8. To inactivate a VC, **toggle** its status to "Inactive."

9. To activate a VC needed, **toggle** its status to "Active."

10. **Click** the "+" button in the rules section to assign VC rates or amounts to be applied on items.

11. For each VC rule, you can provide active dates for the VC items.

12. To remove VC rules or items, simply delete them.

**Below is an example of a VC template:**

![](https://files.readme.io/bd5875c-image.png)

### Uploading files to VC

When working with Variable Considerations (VC) in Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, there are two options for importing data:

1. **Integrating Invoices from Recurly:** If VC is applicable, you can integrate invoices from the Recurly platform into Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced.
2. **Loading a Sales Order File:** Alternatively, you can load a sales order file into the system for which VC is applicable.

Once the data is collected and available in the system, Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced automatically calculates VC based on the configured rules. The calculated VC amounts will be visible in the system, as shown in the provided screenshot.

With Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, VC estimates are automatically applied to transactions based on the VC rules defined during the setup process, streamlining the calculation and application of VC amounts.

![](https://files.readme.io/8f2de29-image.png)

In the revenue workbench of Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, you have the flexibility to manually modify the application of variable consideration. To do this, simply right-click on the specific item you wish to change while in the VC tab. The options available for adjustment can be seen in the provided image.

Any changes made to the variable consideration will be accurately reflected in the Revenue Workbench. If there are any adjustments or updates needed for the variable consideration, they can be performed through VC true-up or by initiating clearance to release the updated information.

![](https://files.readme.io/d52f106-image.png)

**Notes:**

* The transaction price displayed in the Revenue Workbench reflects the price after the adjustments for variable consideration.
* The revenue to date shown in the Revenue Workbench is the cumulative sum of revenue, allocations, and favorable variable considerations scheduled for the respective period.
* The Revenue Workbench provides visibility into the waterfall analysis for variable consideration, showcasing the breakdown and impact of variable consideration on revenue recognition.
* The VC Accrual represents either the amount calculated by the system or the liability that will be cleared once the actuals are incorporated into the process.

## Cost

Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced includes functionality to account for costs. There are two options for managing costs within the system: manual loading of costs or automated calculation based on predefined formulas. The Rules page, specifically the Cost section, is used to define the Cost Type and Cost Rules.

### How to configure a cost type

1. Navigate to Rules and select Cost from the menu.

<Image align="center" className="border" width="25% " border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/f03f8f4-image.png" />

2. Enter the 'Cost Type' to specify the type of cost you are defining.
3. Determine the cost treatment based on the following options:
   1. **Point in time:** Recognize the cost in the month it is incurred.
   2. **Follow Revenue:** Recognize the cost according to the revenue recognition pattern over the contract period.
4. Set the cost keys by clicking on the field and selecting the appropriate options from the pop-up menu. Note that selecting cost keys is optional.
5. If you need the Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced tool to calculate the cost amount, use the "Formula on" feature. Type "Line.SellPrice" (case sensitive) to apply cost rules based on a percentage of the sell price.
6. Specify a unique account number for the debit account ('Dr account number') and the credit account ('Cr account number'). These account numbers will be compared with the Sales Order number.
7. If your incremental cost needs to be amortized and capitalized, activate the "Cost Capitalize" option.\
   ![](https://files.readme.io/b6ce8f1-image.png)
8. Finally, click on the Save icon to save your cost configuration.

To add rules to the cost configuration in order to apply the cost formula to specific contract lines, such as the item "Macbook," follow these steps:

1. Under the cost rules section, click on the "+" button to add a new cost rule.
2. Select the book for which the cost should be applied. This ensures that the cost rule is associated with the correct book.
3. In the "Item" column, enter the name "Macbook" to specify that this cost rule should be applied to contract lines related to the item "Macbook."
4. In the "Value" column, enter the percentage of the sell price that should be treated as cost for the specified item.
5. Click on the save button to save the cost rule.\
   ![](https://files.readme.io/c0e7dae-image.png)

**Note:** If your cost calculation is based on any other attribute other than “item”, go to the mapper and select the required fields.

### Calculation of cost using a cost file

1. Prepare a Cost file that includes the necessary columns reflecting the cost attributes defined in the system. Ensure that the cost type specified in the file matches the cost type already defined in the system.

2. Navigate to the Transactions page in Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced.

3. Click on the "Upload" icon to upload the Cost file.

4. Choose the Cost file from your local system by clicking on "Browse" or "Choose File" and select the appropriate file.\
   ![](https://files.readme.io/43d3a70-image.png)

5. Once the file is selected, click on "Open" to initiate the upload process.

6. The system will process the uploaded Cost file and calculate the cost based on the configuration specified in the Cost Rules. It will apply the calculated cost to the respective contract lines, even if the cost is not explicitly assigned to the item or POB in the contract.

By utilizing the Cost file upload functionality, you can streamline the process of calculating costs based on predefined rules and attributes, enabling accurate cost allocation in your revenue recognition calculations.

## Holds

In Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced, the Holds feature allows for holding revenue recognition based on specific conditions set by management. 

There are two types of holds available: Contract Level hold and Element Level hold.

**Contract Level Hold:**

* A Contract Level hold applies to the entire contract.
* It prevents revenue recognition for the contract until the hold condition is met.
* The hold condition could be a specific event, date, or any other criteria defined by the management.
* Once the hold condition is satisfied, revenue recognition for the contract can proceed.

**Element Level Hold:**

* An Element Level hold applies to individual revenue elements within a contract.
* It allows for holding revenue recognition for specific elements until the hold condition is met.
* Each revenue element can have its own hold condition.
* The hold condition could be based on the fulfillment of certain criteria or the occurrence of specific events.
* Once the hold condition for an element is satisfied, revenue recognition for that particular element can proceed.

The **Holds** feature in Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced provides flexibility in managing revenue recognition by allowing for temporary holds based on defined conditions. It ensures that revenue recognition aligns with the requirements and policies set by management, providing accurate and compliant financial reporting.

8. **Click** on the appropriate buttons to confirm and save the applied hold.

**Notes:**

* In the "Hold" tab of the Revenue Workbench, you can see the information about when and who applied the line hold.
* Holds can also be applied to partial revenue. For example, if 50% of the revenue for a contract has been released, you can apply a hold on the remaining 50% and release it at a later time. The same process mentioned above can be used to apply holds on partial revenue in the Revenue Workbench manually.
