# Implementation process

Recurly Professional Services recommends a multi-phase approach to onboarding merchants to our Revenue Recognition Advanced Edition (RevRec) platform. This approach provides a stable path to success and allows modification for unique requirements as well. The implementation covers the entire spectrum from initial requirement discussions to moving the solution into production with assistance and monitoring by a dedicated Enablement Manager.

## Phase 1 - BRD/CRP Creation and review

The first phase of the Recurly Revenue Recognition Advanced implementation process focuses on the creation and review of both the Business Requirements Document (BRD) and the Configuration Requirement Plan (CRP). The purpose of these documents are for Recurly and the merchant to work together to lay out how the RevRec site should be configured. 

## Phase 2 - Core design & configuration

The focus of the second phase is to leverage the BRD/CRP documents to design the solution and configure the Revenue Recognition module. Recurly’s priority is to design a solution that fits the customers revenue recognition strategy. To ensure accuracy and functionality, Recurly will configure templates, conduct design review(s), and obtain sign-off from the customer on the design.

## Phase 3 - Integration

This phase focuses on the seamless integration of systems. It ensures that all systems are effectively connected, enabling a smooth flow of data and operations. We will also be reviewing and signing off on the test scenarios while the customer validates the configurations and prepares the necessary data. Finally we’ll focus on completing system and integration unit testing. The customer develops test cases, which are reviewed by Recurly. Any identified issues are addressed and resolved by Recurly to ensure a robust and reliable system.

## Phase 4 - UAT

The fourth phase involves User Acceptance Testing (UAT). The customer provisions data, performs data conversion, and executes UAT scenarios. Results are reviewed, and any issues are addressed and re-deployed by Recurly. The UAT is signed off by the customer, indicating their satisfaction with the solution.

## Phase 5 - Go live

The fifth phase is the culmination of the implementation process—Go Live. Recurly prepares a cutover plan, provisions the production environment, and deploys the necessary services. A cutover is conducted to transition from the testing phase to the live environment. The customer prepares final conversion data, performs a sanity check in the production environment, and, with Recurly's support, goes live with the Revenue Recognition Advanced solution.
