# Revenue Recognition user management

## Creating roles and their specifications

Before creating any user, it is necessary to establish roles that define their access and editing privileges within the platform. Roles determine the level of access and functionality a user will have. There are two primary types of roles that can be created: read-only (or access-only) and Administrator roles. The **Site Admin** role is the only role available by default, providing full access to the user with this specification.

To create roles and manage their specific settings, follow these steps:

1. From the **Recurly** main menu, navigate to Admin → Roles → Create a Role.

2. Fill in the Role Name and Roles Description fields.
3. Select the desired configuration in the Permissions section.
   1. Note that in the revenue recognition settings, you can select whether that role provides read-only or admin access. This is something that can only be managed in this initial configuration. We advise you to create two different roles differentiating both read-only and admin access.
   2. However, you can always manage user’s privileges within the revenue recognition [platform](https://docs.recurly.com/docs/access-management#providing-administrator-or-read-only-privileges-in-the-revenue-recognition-site).\

4. Press Create Role.

Within the access configuration screen, specifically in the revenue recognition option, you can specify whether a user with a particular role can access and edit information within the revenue recognition tool. Please note that the configuration of editing privileges or read-only access within the revenue recognition platform must be done within the platform itself.

A read-only user has limited access and can only view data and reports within the revenue recognition platform, without the ability to make modifications. On the other hand, an Administrator user has full access and can perform various administrative tasks, including managing users, configuring settings, and overseeing the overall workflow.

## Creating users and providing Recurly access

In the Recurly User Management section, you have the ability to create new users and grant them access to Recurly's revenue recognition platform. This functionality is available during the initial configuration phase, assuming you have purchased Recurly's revenue recognition service.\
To create a new user and provide them with access to Recurly, follow these steps:

1. From the Recurly main menu, navigate to Admin → Users → User Actions → Invite Users.

2. Fill in the user's email address and select their access level/role. Then, click "Send Invite."\

3. The user will receive an invitation to join the platform and must accept it to participate as part of your team.

4. Once the user has accepted the invitation, you will be able to see and manage their privileges in the Users section under the Admin menu.

5. Press Save to update the user privileges.

Please note that the availability of the revenue recognition section and corresponding permission set depends on the revenue Recognition feature flag being enabled for your Recurly site.
